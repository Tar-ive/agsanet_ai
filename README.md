# Module Spelunker – Agentic Safety Network

Module Spelunker is the landing site for AgsaNet AI, a static intelligence layer that catches brittle agent flows, token waste, and risky SDK usage before they ship to production.

The site is built with **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind**, and the v0 component kit, then fully customized around the Module Spelunker product brief.
